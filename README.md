# Gladiators
## A turn-based game developed by Sascha Villing and Sebastian Voigt

This game is created as an assignment for the course 'Software Engineering' at the HTWG Konstanz.
The corresponding lecture is held by Prof. Marco Boger.

The goal of this assignment is to build a game which works in a Terminal and a GUI.

TODO:
- highlighting legal cells for move command
- attack player base 
- delete gladiator if hp < 0
- celltype gold mine (earn money)
- possibility to move multiple gladiators each turn
- show error messages in GUI (?)
- random names for gladiators (?) 
- prevent "jumping" over palms (extends checkmovingpoints)
