# Gladiators
## A turn-based game developed by Sascha Villing and Sebastian Voigt

This game is created as an assignment for the courses 'Software Engineering' and 'Software Architectures' at the HTWG in Konstanz.
The corresponding lecture is held by Prof. Marco Boger.

This branch is currently in the works of remastering the whole game, as it was written without prior knowledge of Scala and had several big issues.
The goal is to make it functionally correct, bring up the coverage significantly and make it generally nicer to read.
