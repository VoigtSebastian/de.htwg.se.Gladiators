# Gladiators
## A turn-based game developed by Sascha Villing and Sebastian Voigt

This game is created as an assignment for the courses 'Software Engineering',
'Software Architectures' and 'Web Technology' at the HTWG Konstanz.
The corresponding lecture is held by Prof. Marco Boger.

This game has been rewritten from he ground up and is currently functionally
finished but will be extended with several changes, to make it more
user-friendly.
